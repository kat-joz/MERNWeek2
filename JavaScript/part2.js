// VARIABLES and DATA TYPES

/*
    In JavaScript TYPES of data are 
    DYNAMIC and MUTABLE
    they are stored as text in memory until they are needed
    they are converted to whatever 'seems' best
*/

// VARIABLES

/*
    * 'let' is your standard variable (to be able to change)
    * 'const' if we have a constant variable (won't change)
    * 'var' the old and insecure way of storing variables
    * we use camelCase for naming
*/

// DATATYPES

/*
    two types of 'types'
    primatives and objects
    similar to java
    primatives : boolean, number, string, null, undefined, bigint, symbol
    objects : objects
